## Purpose of Project:
The purpose of the project is to allow people to help find missing children. We do this by making it easier for people to report a sighting of a missing child and give resources to those who might rescue a missing child. Along with that, the app also brings awareness to how big of an issue we have with missing children.
## Tools utilized:
ECL, JavaScript, React Native, Expo Go, Figma
## Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them:
The main problem that we ran into was having to learn ECL and JavaScript in a single day. There were many ideas we wanted to code in both ECL and JavaScript but weren't able to do, so we did what we could and explained how we could implement the rest of our ideas.
